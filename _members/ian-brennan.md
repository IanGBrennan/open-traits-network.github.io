## Collaboration Statement
I enjoy using and developing phylogenetic comparative methods to study macroevolutionary patterns and diversification dynamics. I mostly study reptiles, but Iâ€™m not picky about focal organisms, and am happy to chat about how comparative methods may be useful in your research.
